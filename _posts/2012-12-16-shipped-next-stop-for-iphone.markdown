title: Shipped&#58; Next Stop for iPhone
---

[Next Stop](http://nextstop.me) lets you set an alarm for the bus stop you want to hop off at. Before you reach the bus stop, you get a push-style notification telling you to hop off. Next Stop became available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/next-stop/id583674519?ls=1&mt=8) on the 12th of December. It's the third app I've published to the App Store.

The motivation behind the project came from being anxious when catching new bus routes. I remember getting off a bus stop early and having to walk 1KM in the rain when I was staying in [Fig Tree Pocket](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/next-stop/id583674519?ls=1&mt=8). I commuted on public transport everyday, wishing more people would catch [public transport](http://translink.com.au/). I'm not a town planner, but I can write software. Building Next Stop is my small contribution toward making public transport better for everyone.

If you're in Brisbane, [give it a try](http://nextstop.me/). I'd love to [have your feedback](mailto:support@nextstop.me?subject=Feedback).
