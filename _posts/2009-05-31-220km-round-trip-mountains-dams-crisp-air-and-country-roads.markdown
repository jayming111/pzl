It's the first weekend I've had no obligations to uni, friends or family. Couldn't think of a better way to celebrate than a long ride with my old man and his mate. We started on Brisbane's southside and followed the Ipswitch motorway. Our route took us over the Wivenhoe Dam wall, past Somerset, through Kilcoy and over Mount Mee with various stops on the way. It was an epic ride, out for a total of seven hours.

With the recent heavy rains, the inland routes are looking spectacular. The dams had attracted a tonne of people interested in water sports and family picnics. Being low to the ground with no obstructions, riding fast in between giant mountains and feeling the wind against your face is amazingly refreshing.
