title: My Desktop Was Minimal Before Migrating to OS X

It's possible to achieve a minimal Linux desktop, even if you're unlikely to see one.

Do you really need your processor utilisation, network traffic and weather sitting in your panel? It's like you're supporting the minority use case a majority of the time. As an end user, you shouldn't care how much your processor is being utilised. If you really want to know the weather, take a look out the window. Panels and task lists are redundant. Looking at the desktop, it's easy to identify which applications are at your disposal. When in doubt, Beryl supported an expos&eacute;-like feature.
