First time participating in a large, community bicycle ride was a lot of fun and a great way to spend Sunday morning. Had originally registered for the 30km route. Through a combination of poor signage and lack of awareness, I followed everyone onto the 45km route. In retrospect, I'm glad I took the wrong turn. Completing the 45km is a testament to my regular riding. Wasn't as exhausted as the first time I cycled 30km.
