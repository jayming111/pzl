title: Next Stop is Hopping Off
---

Today I made the decision to remove Next Stop for sale on the App Store. I posted this message on the [Next Stop website](http://nextstop.me).

> Next Stop is no longer available on the App Store. It was fun to build and made sure I got off at the right stop. The truth is, it hasn't sold that well and apps like TripGo do the same thing and everything else a commuter could want. At the end of the day, I support any well built piece of software that helps to increase public transport consumption. Everyone wins when someone chooses to catch a bus instead of driving a car. Thank you to everyone who supported Next Stop, especially Jason Weathered, Odin Dutton and Rachael Battle.

How well is not well? About 1-3 sales per day. [Antenna Mate](http://antennamate.com) sells *much* better than that and at for 2.5 times the price. Next Stop was an enormous effort to build. In retrospect, there were a lot of things I could have cut from scope. It took a weekend to build logging with the expectation that people would submit logs so I could help debug Core Location. Number of logs I received? Zero.

Since building Next Stop I've strived to keep focus on the core problem and shipping as early as possible. At the end of the day, you can only commit a finite number of hours to a project and you've got to make that project count for something.

What I've always wanted is an app I could tell where I'm going and it figures out the route and tells me where to get off. That's what [TripGo](http://skedgo.com) does. There's some good people behind it and I wish them all the best. Now I feel free to focus.

I'm finishing this post off with an experimental design I was contemplating for Next Stop. It was intentionally high contrast to increase visibility for people with vision impairments.
