<h2>About</h2>

<p>Tate Johnson is defaults kind of guy and software developer living in Sydney, Australia. I built <a href="http://antennamate.com">Antenna Mate</a>, <a href="https://tugapp.com">Tug</a> and lead development at <a href="https://thebestday.com">TheBestDay</a>. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/tatejohnson/">Twitter</a>, fork my code on <a href="http://github.com/tatey">GitHub</a>, spectate my shots on <a href="http://dribbble.com/tatejohnson">Dribbble</a>, hear what I listen to on <a href="http://last.fm/user/Tatey/">Last.fm</a> or subscribe to my blog's <a href="{{ base.url }}/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="{% asset_path me_large.jpg %}"><img id="left" src="{% asset_path me_thumb.jpg %}" alt="Tate Johnson" /></a>My love of computers started when the old man showed me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia</a> on a 386. I bounced from a gamer interested in PC hardware, to a Linux fanatic who would install a <a href="http://archlinux.org">distribution</a> on anything with 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s before developing a genuine passion for nice software.</p>

<p>Between February 2008 and December 2011 I worked at <a href="http://everydayhero.com">Everyday Hero</a>, a service empowering not for profits to multiply their fundraising efforts. As a small company I did a bunch of things, but mainly Ruby on Rails. In October 2011 Everyday Hero was acquired by <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com">Blackbaud</a>, a large US software company. Frustrated over the direction of the product and genuinely looking for a change I moved to Ennova in January 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://ennova.com.au">Ennova</a> created Envision, a product for simplifying event and personnel management in the construction and mining industries. I lead and shipped <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/envision/id404665551?mt=8">Envision for iPhone</a> as well as consulting on bespoke client projects. By July 2012 I decided to focus entirely on a product and moved to Sydney with my <a href="http://rachaelbattle.com">girlfriend</a> to lead development at <a href="https://thebestday.com">TheBestDay</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work I graduated with a Bachelor of Information Technology from <a href="http://griffith.edu.au">Griffith University</a> in December 2010. At my final year of university I designed, built and shipped <a href="http://antennamate.com">Antenna Mate</a> for iPhone and iPad. Antenna Mate takes the guess work out of pointing a TV antenna from anywhere in Australia and the United Kingdom. It recently sold it's 6,000th copy on the Australian App Store.</p>

<p>Later on I really came to like Heroku. It made it possible to do things like spin up an instance for each branch on GitHub. That prototype evolved into <a href="https://tugapp.com">Tug</a>. Now it does hosted continuous deployment from GitHub to Heroku. I've also <a href="https://github.com/tatey">created and contributed to several open source projects</a>. I love my girlfriend, good software, Ruby/Rails, JavaScript/AngularJS and Objective-C/iOS.</p>
