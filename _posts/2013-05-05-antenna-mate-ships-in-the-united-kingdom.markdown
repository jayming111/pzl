title: Antenna Mate Ships in the United Kingdom
---

[Antenna Mate](http://antennamate.com) has been for sale on the [Australian App Store](http://appstore.com/antennamate) since January 2011. It's sold over 6,000 copies and has an average rating of 4.5 stars from 48 ratings. It's appeared in a [magazine](http://www.candm.com.au/magazine) and gets recommended by customers on [various](http://car.caravanersforum.com/~caravane/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=32604) [caravanning](http://www.candm.com.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=8586&p=90562) [forums](http://www.exploroz.com/Forum/Topic/101815/TV_Reception_iPad_app.aspx). Not bad for a little project I started in my final year of university.

I've always been interested to know what would happen if these numbers could be replicated in other countries. If Antenna Mate went on sale in the United Kingdom would the total number of sales double?

Picking the second country for Antenna Mate required some research. I started by looking at existing traffic to the website. The United States seemed like an obvious choice. After Australia, the United States made up 15% of the total traffic. More interestingly Americans were landing on the website through organic searches with keywords like "tv antenna direction app". Very promising.

The problem is data. The [FCC](http://www.fcc.gov/) publishes terrestrial television data in a pipe delimited text file, but doesn't provide enough context to turn raw data into meaningful information for an antenna installer or caravaner. Admittedly I don't know much about terrestrial television in the United States.

Going back to the website, the next biggest group was from the United Kingdom. They made up 5% of the total traffic and were arriving through similar organic searches. Terrestrial television is culturally popular in the United Kingdom and there are a couple of big [caravanning websites](http://www.caravantalk.co.uk/). More importantly, [Ofcom](http://www.ofcom.org.uk/) publishes similar raw data to the [ACMA](http://www.acma.gov.au/) in Australia. That meant there would be less changes required to the code and the data could be reliably imported.

I estimated that it would take about 10-16 hours to write a script to import the data, verify that it worked from inside the United Kingdom, localise the application and update the website. It probably took closer to 20 hours, but I'm happy to say that it's now on the [App Store](http://appstore.com/antennamate). If I were to fund that 20 hours from revenue at market contracting rates then it costs me about 3 months of revenue. But since it's more of a fun side project, I don't.

If you're in the United Kingdom give it a try and let me know what you think. If you're in the United States and could help with data, I'd also be interested to [hear from you](mailto:tate@tatey.com).
