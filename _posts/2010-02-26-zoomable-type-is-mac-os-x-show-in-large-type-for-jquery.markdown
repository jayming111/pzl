title: Zoomable Type is Mac OS X's &ldquo;Show in Large Type&rdquo; for jQuery
---

[Zoomable Type is a jQuery plugin](http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/) for reading small text on a display from far away. Text is upscaled to the largest size based on its width and the browser's viewport.

I'm building a web application with many contact numbers. Reading a contact number off a display and typing it into a handset can be difficult when the text is small and you lose your place. Apple have already solved this problem in Mac OS X with the “Show in Large Type” functionality found in Address Book and Mail. Zoomable Type implements this as a jQuery plugin for the web. Zoomable Type is [hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/tatey/jquery-zoomabletype/) and distributed under the MIT licence. Try some examples on the [project home page](http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/).
