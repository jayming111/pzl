title: Tatey Open Sourced Tatey/NextStop
---

I spent many [nights and weekends](https://github.com/tatey/NextStop/graphs/punch-card) on Next Stop to make catching public transport in Brisbane better for everyone. Then I moved to Sydney and stopped catching public transport altogether in favour of walking and riding. There were people building [better](http://www.triptasticapp.com/) [apps](http://www.skedgo.com/tripgo) than Next Stop and my focus shifted to [other](https://www.thebestday.com) [things](https://tugapp.com).

Now I'm happy to announce that [Next Stop is available as an open source project](https://github.com/tatey/NextStop). There are things I'd do differently next time round, but it's better to be open than gathering virtual dust on my hard drive. Maybe you can learn something from it.
