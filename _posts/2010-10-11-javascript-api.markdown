title: JavaScript API
---

Poor documentation always put me off learning JavaScript. Most of what I had learnt came from miscellaneous tutorials, other people's code and my own experimentation. When I started learning Java, searching for "Java API" yields the 1.5.0 documentation. Likewise, Ruby's API documentation is the first result for "Ruby API". If the keywords "JavaScript API" do not yield anything useful on the first few pages of Google, it must not exist.

Contrary to my earlier beliefs, good documentation does exist for JavaScript. [Micheil Smith](http://brandedcode.com/) linked me to the [Mozilla Developer Center JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference). After browsing the documentation my immediate thought was this should be the first result in search engines for "JavaScript API" and did nothing about it. After reading [Micheil's tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/miksago/status/27013179722) I felt compelled to write this post. By linking to [JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference), I'm hoping to influence search engines to include Mozilla's JavaScript reference at the top.
