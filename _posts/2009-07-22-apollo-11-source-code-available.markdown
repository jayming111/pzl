title: Apollo 11 Source Code Available
---

[Ilya Grigorik pointed out](http://twitter.com/igrigorik/status/2756421525) that the source code used in the Apollo 11 mission is now available on Google Code. Interested to see the software responsible for landing a man on the moon, I browsed the [lunar landing guidance equations](http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/source/browse/trunk/Luminary099/LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.s?r=258). I'm not even going to pretend to understand, as I know full well how difficult programming in assembly can be.

Just for comparison I've published calculating a factorial in [assembly](http://gist.github.com/151309) on the Motorola 6800 (80 lines without comments) versus [Ruby](http://gist.github.com/151316) (3 lines). It really makes me appreciate the abstraction away from the hardware in higher generation languages. Hats off to the engineers of the 1960's.
