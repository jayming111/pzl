title: Ahri-ly Liked This Birthday Message
---

I like puns and I like [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com). My friend [Hannah Haysom](http://www.hannahhaysom.com/) managed to combine the two into a pun-tastic birthday message.

> Dear Tate,
>
> Lee Sin up, because I have a birthday message for you, and I hope it won’t be in Vayne.
>
> I’ve got a Zilean things I could say on this special occasion. For example, I wish you all the Lux in the world, and I hope you never have to deal with any Graves Miss Fortune. I’d also like to think I could Ryze to the occasion on your birthday and make a few puns (because you love them), but I can’t think of Annie. I then thought that I could make a joke, but chances are it would Nocturne out the way Irelia want it to. Udyr, I seem to be rambling. 
>
> Joking aside, let’s get Ezreal for a second. You’re a Sivir-ly awesome guy – and not to mention Talon-ted. As a Sion-tist, I can say that with authority. I think you’ve got a lot of good Karma built up.
>
> So on this special occasion, get ready to Rumble, pop a Corki or two, and I Garen-tee you’ll have a good time!
>
> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
>
> P.S. Don’t get Singed by the candles on your birthday cake (it’s Poppy-seed)!

Ahri-ly liked it.
