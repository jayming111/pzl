title: Design is an Iterative Process
---

I've been watching my girlfriend get frustrated at designing her first website. She gets put off after working so hard on something that doesn't work out the way she thought it would. I keep reminding her that design is an iterative process. The Antenna Mate that thousands of people [use today](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/8691229793/in/set-72157633377668866/) is not the same Antenna Mate that [first shipped](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/8692347604/in/set-72157633377668866/) on the App Store. In fact, I'm really embarrassed by the earlier versions. But I shipped, and I couldn't have gotten where I did without iterating. You only need to look at the earlier versions of [GitHub](http://blog.directededge.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/github.png) and [Mac OS X](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/MacOSX10-0screenshot.png) to see the same pattern repeat itself. If your core purpose is solid, then hard work and polish will pay off.
